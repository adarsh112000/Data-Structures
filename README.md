# Data-Structures

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it complicated that there area no obvious deficiencies.


Programs :
  1. Linked List
  2. Stack
  3. Queue
  4. Binary Tree
  5. Linear Search
  6. Merge Sort

All these programs are created by myself.
